## 1. Executive Summary

Our solution implements a multimodal ensemble approach combining advanced text processing with deep image features to predict product prices. We developed a comprehensive pipeline that extracts semantic features from product descriptions using TF-IDF and ResNet50-based image embeddings, achieving competitive performance through ensemble modeling and SMAPE-optimized calibration techniques.

## 2. Methodology Overview

### 2.1 Problem Analysis

We interpreted the pricing challenge as a multimodal regression problem where both textual product descriptions and visual product images contain complementary pricing signals. Our exploratory data analysis revealed several key insights about the relationship between product attributes and pricing.

**Key Observations:**
- Product descriptions contain rich information about Item Pack Quantity (IPQ), brand indicators, and quality descriptors
- Image features provide visual cues about product size, materials, and premium characteristics  
- Price distribution spans a wide range ($0.54 - $672.20) requiring robust scaling and calibration
- Text length, keyword presence, and numerical values in descriptions correlate with price ranges
- Systematic underestimation was a major challenge requiring specialized calibration techniques

### 2.2 Solution Strategy

Our approach combines multiple data modalities through an ensemble framework optimized specifically for SMAPE minimization.

**Approach Type:** Multimodal Ensemble  
**Core Innovation:** SMAPE-optimized ensemble calibration with ResNet50 image features and advanced text processing
